-- * Rational

-- | Simplify the ratio to avoid a long representation:

-- > λ> toRational 0.123456
-- > 8895942329546431 % 72057594037927936
-- > λ> approxRational (toRational 0.123456) (1 % 10000)
-- > 10 % 81
-- > λ> 10 / 81
-- > 0.12345679012345678   (wow, that's wierd)

-- This is important for values that might become part of a path,
-- we don't want them to be too long or subject to rounding errors.
